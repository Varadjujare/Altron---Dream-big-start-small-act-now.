# 🛑 What to Do Next (Vercel)

1.  **Go to Vercel**: Open your dashboard at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
2.  **Find Your Project**: Click on the project named `Altron...`.
3.  **Check Status**:
    *   Look at the **Production Deployment** section.
    *   It should say **"Ready"** (Green dot) or **"Building"** (Blue/Yellow dot).
    *   If it is "Building", **WAIT** until it finishes.
4.  **Open the App**:
    *   Once "Ready", click the **Domain Link** (e.g., `altron-xyz.vercel.app`).
    *   It should verify that the "404 Error" is GONE.
5.  **Test Login**:
    *   Try logging in with a user.
    *   If it works, we are DONE! 🎉

*(If you still see an error, click the "Logs" tab in Vercel and tell me what it says!)*
